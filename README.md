# ISSTracker

This Python program utilizes the ISS coordenates from NASA's API to dynamically show the International Space Station (ISS) on a globe image. By leveraging the power of geographical information and real-time ISS location updates (every 5 seconds), this tool provides a visually appealing representation of the ISS's orbital path on Earth.

More than the visual map with real-time movements of the ISS the program also prints the coordinates, every 5 seconds.
